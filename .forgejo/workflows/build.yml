# This action script just calls the reusable entry point on
# https://git.maemo.org/leste-cicd/forgejo-workflows in .forgejo/workflows/maemo-entry.yml
# Because of limitations in Forgejo Actions at the time of writing, our custom
# Forgejo build will replace any workflow called "build.yml" with the contents of
# the reusable workflow.
#
# So technically, the contents of this file do not matter at all, it doesn't
# even have to be syntactically correct, but let's just try to make it correct.
#
# For the Forgejo lacking features / bugs refer to
# https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/8780
